##Setup

Drag the bootstrapCalQlik folder and put it into your extensions folder on either you local machine or on your accesspoint. 
Next you can add the extension to your Qlikview project (make sure you are in web view so that you can add the extension object).
Customize and you are done!

#####You may need to change the qva.loadcss to the commented out one when working with the extension on access point*

##This extension will screw the css for the default qlikview control. If you use this you will only be able to use this for datepicking.
